			<p>Cairole was referred to my husband and I to design a room addition that we wanted to add to my childhood home that was built in 1959 that we were moving into.  She first worked with us on more of the structural engineering side to ensure we had a solid structure and then moved into the design phase.  I have to say Cairole is one of the easiest going, take the time to explain things engineer I have met with.  I am a visual person and through our meetings together we were able to see, through automation, exactly what our ideas would look like and with her suggested ideas and changes how they made the addition look even better.  The true testimonial comes when you take your blueprints to the permitting office and there are no changes that need to be made to the drawings.  It made the permitting process seamless!  There were a few questions that we had along the construction way and Cairole was always there to give us quick guidance and answers.  I would highly recommend Cairole Woordward for any type of construction/engineering/design needs.</p>

			<p>I’ve worked with Cairole for over 10 years, and she is awesome to work with! As a Realtor, time is of the essence with all transactions, and Cairole is easy to reach and is very responsive.  My clients all appreciate the depth of her structural engineering knowledge, and her straightforward approach. She’ll tell them what’s important, and what’s not a big deal. From large projects to smaller guidance needs, she’s there to help with her vast base of expertise. I’d highly recommend Cairole Woodward to anyone who needs structural engineering and interior design advice.</p>

			<p>We engaged Samson Engineering for a remodel project to build an 2nd level sunroom extending over a lower level patio, including a rooftop deck on the sunroom.  The project was especially complex because it involved undoing poorly engineered diy structural work from a previous homeowner.  Cairole stepped in to bridge with her engineering expertise between the architects concepts, our construction contractor and the many eccentricities of our existing structure.  Her interaction and engineering knowledge was the key “glue” that allowed the project to move forward.  She was available in a timely manner throughout the year-long project as new questions arose.  Our construction contractor relied extensively on her advice and really enjoyed working with her.  The final structure is quite impressive and very rock solid.   I strongly recommend Samson Engineering for residential construction and remodel work, including evaluation of the structural aspects of older homes. </p>
